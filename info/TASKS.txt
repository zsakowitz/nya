before nyalang version can be released:
❌ proper docs
❌ `2 < 3 < 4` works as expected
❌ mutating functions like `stroke` and `path` shouldn't really exist
❌ exact fractions
❌ list distribution
❌ `min(1, 2, 7, 9)` still works
❌ trig angle
❌ shaders
❌ geometric object plotting
❌ geometric object selection
❌ geometric object dragging
❌ sliders
❌ tokens
❌ derivatives
✅ mobile keyboard
✅ automatic coercion

keyboard improvements:
❌ split parentheses
❌ press and hold for l/r parentheses
❌ press and hold for more trig
❌ unified greek letters
❌ use native keyboard with extra keys
❌ six-row layout
❌ vim mode

to do list for things desmos hid is:
❌ apply, rotation, etc.
✅ erf

to do list for functions is:

❌ chisqtest
❌ geodist
❌ apparently they have twenty inference functions now ???
❌ random, shuffle

✅ 3D points and vectors
✅ ceil, floor, round for complex numbers
✅ logb

to do list for things to plot is:
❌ f(x)
❌ y = f(x) (this sort of works but not that well)
❌ f(x, y) = g(x, y) (this sort of works but not that well)
❌ (x(t), y(t))
❌ a for 2<t<3
❌ f(θ)
❌ f(r, θ) = g(r, θ)

to do list for syntax is:
❌ f'(x)
❌ ∫
❌ ∑, ∏

to do list for features is:
❌ actions
❌ tickers
❌ inequality borders

❌ more stuff works in shaders
❌ arc functions work in shaders
❌ regressions
❌ tone
❌ 3D
❌ draggable expression list
❌ persistent graph state
❌ construction menu
❌ dependent geometry objects can be dragged
❌ slider variables infer bounds based on usage (glider, rgb, hsv)
❌ folders
❌ normal images
❌ tokens for parallel, glider, intersection, bisectors
❌ objects are automatically grabbable in function names, lists, and operators
❌ construct vector from vector and starting point
😐 sliders
😐 images
😐 100% compatible piecewise functions (lists are weird)
✅ grabbing objects previews the result
✅ functions
✅ angle bisector picker
✅ perpendicular bisector picker

❌ tetration
❌ editable text boxes
❌ collaborative editing
❌ /*! https://nbviewer.org/url/jakevdp.github.io/downloads/notebooks/XKCD_plots.ipynb */
✅ slope field

to do list for 110% compatiability is:
❌ width and height as variables
❌ `f(min)=2` throws a more reasonable error
❌ trigAngleMultiplier
❌ rtxsqpone(r32) = r32^2 + 1
❌ rtxsqmone(r32) = r32^2 - 1
